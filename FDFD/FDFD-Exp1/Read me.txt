FDFD-Exp1: A High-Order FDM for Room Impulse Response Simulation


Project Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for Experiment 1 of the paper: "A High-Order Frequency-Domain Finite-Difference Method for Room Impulse Response Simulation". This experiment code demonstrates our method's robustness by showing consistent RIR simulation results across different approximate source models. The simulation is performed from 700â€“1000 Hz with step size $h=1/15$ m. The two approximate source functions are the Gaussian function and the Bump function.
