FDFD-Exp2: A High-Order FDM for Room Impulse Response Simulation


Project Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for Experiment 2 of the paper: "A High-Order Frequency-Domain Finite-Difference Method for Room Impulse Response Simulation". This experiment code demonstrates our method's robustness by showing consistent RIR simulation results across three cases and comparing them with COMSOL results.
Case1:  \sigma=h,  \epsilon = 1e-8
Case2:  \sigma =2h,  \epsilon = 1e-8 
Case2:  \sigma =h,  \epsilon = 1e-4 
 The simulation is performed from 50-250 Hz with step size $h=0.1$ m.
